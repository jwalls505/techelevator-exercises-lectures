-- ORDERING RESULTS

-- Populations of all countries in descending order
SELECT name FROM country ORDER BY population DESC;

--Names of countries and continents in ascending order
SELECT name, continent FROM country ORDER BY continent ASC, name ASC;
SELECT name, continent FROM country ORDER BY name ASC, continent ASC;


-- LIMITING RESULTS
-- The name and average life expectancy of the countries with the 10 highest life expectancies.
SELECT  name, lifeexpectancy 
FROM    country 
WHERE   lifeexpectancy IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY lifeexpectancy DESC 
LIMIT   10 ;


-- CONCATENATING OUTPUTS

-- The name & state of all cities in California, Oregon, or Washington.
-- "city, state", sorted by state then city
SELECT (name || ', ' || district) AS "city_state" FROM city WHERE district IN ('California', 'Oregon', 'Washington') ORDER BY district, name;

-- AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
-- Average Life Expectancy in the World
SELECT lifeexpectancy FROM country;
SELECT AVG(lifeexpectancy) FROM country;
SELECT continent, AVG(lifeexpectancy) FROM country GROUP BY continent ORDER BY continent;

-- Total population in Ohio
SELECT SUM(population) AS "Sum of Population in Ohio" FROM city WHERE district='Ohio';

-- The surface area of the smallest country in the world
SELECT MIN(surfacearea) FROM country;

-- The 10 largest countries in the world
SELECT name, surfacearea FROM country ORDER BY surfacearea DESC LIMIT 10;

-- The number of countries who declared independence in 1991
SELECT COUNT(name) FROM country WHERE indepyear=1991;

-- GROUP BY
-- Count the number of countries where each language is spoken, ordered from most countries to least
SELECT language, COUNT(*) AS number_spoken FROM countrylanguage GROUP BY language ORDER BY number_spoken DESC;

-- Average life expectancy of each continent ordered from highest to lowest
SELECT continent, AVG(lifeexpectancy) AS avg_expectancy FROM country GROUP BY continent ORDER BY avg_expectancy DESC;

-- Exclude Antarctica from consideration for average life expectancy
SELECT continent, AVG(lifeexpectancy) AS avg_expectancy FROM country WHERE lifeexpectancy IS NOT NULL GROUP BY continent ORDER BY avg_expectancy DESC;

-- Sum of the population of cities in each state in the USA ordered by state name
SELECT district, SUM(population) FROM city WHERE countrycode = 'USA' GROUP BY district ORDER BY district;

-- The average population of cities in each state in the USA ordered by state name
SELECT district, AVG(population) FROM city WHERE countrycode = 'USA' GROUP BY district ORDER BY district;

-- SUBQUERIES
-- Find the names of cities under a given government leader
SELECT name AS city_name FROM city WHERE countrycode IN (SELECT code FROM country WHERE headofstate = 'Beatrix');

-- Find the names of cities whose country they belong to has not declared independence yet

SELECT countrycode, name 
FROM city 
WHERE countrycode IN    (SELECT code 
                         FROM   country 
                         WHERE  indepyear IS NULL) 
ORDER BY countrycode, name
LIMIT 10;

-- Additional samples
-- You may alias column and table names to be more descriptive

-- Alias can also be used to create shorthand references, such as "c" for city and "co" for country.

-- Ordering allows columns to be displayed in ascending order, or descending order (Look at Arlington)

-- Limiting results allows rows to be returned in 'limited' clusters,where LIMIT says how many, and OFFSET (optional) specifies the number of rows to skip

-- Most database platforms provide string functions that can be useful for working with string data. In addition to string functions, string concatenation is also usually supported, which allows us to build complete sentences if necessary.

-- Aggregate functions provide the ability to COUNT, SUM, and AVG, as well as determine MIN and MAX. Only returns a single row of value(s) unless used with GROUP BY.

-- Counts the number of rows in the city table

-- Also counts the number of rows in the city table

-- Gets the SUM of the population field in the city table, as well as
-- the AVG population, and a COUNT of the total number of rows.

-- Gets the MIN population and the MAX population from the city table.

-- Using a GROUP BY with aggregate functions allows us to summarize information for a specific column. For instance, we are able to determine the MIN and MAX population for each countrycode in the city table.
